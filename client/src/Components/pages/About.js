      <p className="my-1">Young people thrive on competition, challenges and attention. Being the most influential age group, these individuals hold a lot of sway and hence have the ability to make a sizable change. We thought to put these things together and create a global challenge for young individuals to have a positive impact on their community and the natural world through technology.<br></br><br></br>We created an app that allows users to partake in challenges within our app that guide them through a list of tasks to be completed, with prizes/rewards given to the users that complete all of these tasks first. These tasks involve actions that do good within the community, such as carpooling with a friend, shopping with reusable bags, etc. The user submits proof of a task's completion and the challenge judges check these proofs (in the order they were submitted).<br></br><br></br>The prize goes to the user(s) that finish all the challenge tasks first</p>
